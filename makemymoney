PERSONAL LOANS FOR STUDENTS
Being a student in today's economy can be a tough job. With hiking prices and taxes, colleges and universities are hiking their fees as well. For a bright future, it sometimes becomes a necessity to get a loan. It helps to pay for the food and living expenses or the extra expenses incurred through a term. A student can use a personal loan for many reasons, especially if they come from a more impoverished background.
A personal loan can be taken out instantly and is thus very advantageous. It can pay for urgent medical emergency or tuition fees. It is also an unsecured loan. Because of this, no asset is required to be given as collateral to the bank. Students barely have any considerable asset to their name, so this is a boon. This type of loan also has a low-interest amount. Make My Money helps you to get the loan amount you want with the qualifications you have.
The main problem with students obtaining loans of any kind at a is that they have no real financial backing. They have no assets to their name, and they mostly don't have a regular income. Neither do students have excellent credit scores. Giving loans to students, thus becomes a subject of risk to the banks.
For all of the reasons as mentioned above and more, students are often left wondering if they can get a personal loan from banks.
Students can get a personal loan, but only if they have a source of income. Without a job, it might not be possible for a student to get a personal loan as the banks require some employment history, credit score, etc. Because of this, they are generally not eligible for personal loans. But they can make up for it by applying for an educational loan or personal loan for education.
Education Loans- A student can take this loan to fund their future studies, in either India or abroad. An adult guardian is needed as co-applicant for this process, to ensure that the loan gets repaid in time. The repayment of this loan is tax-free, unlike many other loans like home loans. This is done to ensure that students can pay attention to their future without stress about money.
Make sure to read the fine print and learn the interest rate clearly before signing the documents. If not, the debt amount can bog you down, and you will end up paying the interest amounts long into your adulthood. The costs of Education loans can quickly add up.
Make My Money helps you to customize the criteria and make up for the lack of qualifications in certain areas.
